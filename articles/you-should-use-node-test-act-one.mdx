Hi folks! ðŸ‘‹

In the JavaScript ecosystem, I have always appreciated of **Deno** and **Bun**, that they have natively integrated a **testing system**. This allows you to run the tests without the need to install any external dependencies. In 2021, the Node.js team has also moved in that direction. Opening an [issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/40954) for discussion of how useful it might be to have a native testing system and, 5 months later, a [PR](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/42325) was submitted to implement it.

Basically, the new native `node:test` module is a test runner that allows you to run the tests. The APIs are designed to be as similar as possible to the [node-tap](https://node-tap.org/basics/) framework, so if you've used it before, you'll feel right at home.

I'm not here to tell you that you have to stop using framework _X_ or _Y_ to use `node:test`. I'm here to tell you about my experience migrating almost **~1500** tests, of different projects, from `node-tap` to `node:test`. I refactored almost the entire [Platformatic](https://github.com/platformatic/platformatic/issues/1796) monorepo codebase to use the new `node:test` module. The [same](https://github.com/mcollina/async-cache-dedupe/pull/107) with the [async-cache-dedupe](https://github.com/mcollina/async-cache-dedupe/pull/107) module, and many other ones. ([expirables](https://github.com/Cadienvan/expirables/pull/40), [orama-cache](https://github.com/mateonunez/orama-cache/pull/123), [etc](https://github.com/mateonunez/asterism/pull/119)).

If you are wondering which frameworks I like to use to test my applications, I like these the most:

- [node-tap](https://github.com/tapjs/tapjs)
- [vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest)
- [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)

> There are specific use cases for each type of framework. The `node-tap` framework I used mainly in pure Node.js . `Vite`, on the other hand, for frontend applications while `Playwright` for E2E testing.

## Act One

In this series of articles, I will share my personal experience moving from different testing frameworks to the new Node Test Runner. I will also share some tips and tricks that I have learned along the way.

The **Act One** consists of a brief introduction to the `node:test` module and some basic concepts that you should know before starting to use it.

### How it looks like?

The `node:test` module is a module that is installed by default when you install Node.js.

To use it, you need to create a file with the name `whateva.test.js` or `whateva.test.mjs` in the test folder of your project.

```js
// cjs
const { test } = require('node:test');
const { equal } = require('node:assert');

// or esm
import { test } from 'node:test';
import { equal } from 'node:assert';

test('should be equal', () => {
  equal(1, 1);
});
```

Run the tests:

```bash
node --test
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

Note: when you run `node --test` the test runner will look for all the files that match the following patterns:

- `**/*.test.?(c|m)js`
- `**/*-test.?(c|m)js`
- `**/*_test.?(c|m)js`
- `**/test-*.?(c|m)js`
- `**/test.?(c|m)js`
- `**/test/**/*.?(c|m)js`

> You can find more information about the _execution model_ in the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#test-runner-execution-model).

### Test runner

The first concept you should know is the _test runner_. The test runner, as the name implies, is the functionality that allows you to run a single test. Each test you will run in your application will be executed, discovered, and reported by the test runner.

Each test, and their subtests, will be executed in a separate child process. If the test fail the process exit code will be set to `1`.

Tests created via the test module consist of a single function that is processed in one of three ways:

1. A sync function fails if it errors, and passes otherwise.
2. A function with a Promise fails if it rejects, and passes if it fulfills.
3. A function with a callback fails if the callback gets a truthy value first, otherwise it passes. If it returns a Promise too, it fails.

### Subtests

The subtests are tests that are executed within a test. This is a very useful feature when you want to group tests that are related to each other (or not).

```js
import { test } from 'node:test';
import { equal, notDeepEqual } from 'node:assert';

test('group of tests', async (t) => {
  await t.test('should be equal', () => {
    equal(1, 1);
  });

  await t.test('should be not equal', () => {
    notDeepEqual(1, 2);
  });
});
```

Subtests are executed in the same process as the parent test. This means that if a subtest fails, the parent test will also fail. Furthermore, you need to `await` the subtests to ensure that they are executed before the parent test ends. Any subtests that are not awaited will be cancelled and treated as a failure, doing so will cause the parent test to fail.

#### Describe and It syntax

Subtests can also be written using the `describe` and `it` functions. The `describe` function is an alias for `test` and the `it` function is an alias for `t.test`.

```js
import { describe, it } from 'node:test';
import { equal, notDeepEqual } from 'node:assert';

describe('group of tests', () => {
  it('should be equal', () => {
    equal(1, 1);
  });

  it('should be not equal', () => {
    notDeepEqual(1, 2);
  });
});
```

When you're using the `describe`/`it` syntax, keep in mind that a [SuiteContext](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#class-suitecontext) is created for each `describe` block. It's only the constructor and it doesn't expose any APIs or properties. The `it` function, generates a [TestContext](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#class-testcontext) for each test.

The **Act One** is over. In the next **act**, we will expolre more features of the `node:test` module.
