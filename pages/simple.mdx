Today was released the first stable version of [Asterism](https://github.com/mateonunez/asterism). Asterism provides a CLI to manage your Lyra instances and searches in a simple way.

## What is Lyra?

Lyra is a search engine created by [Michele Riva](https://twitter.com/MicheleRivaCode). Lyra makes **thousands** searches within a few **microseconds** (_μs_) (yes, ms / 1000).

The main idea of Lyra is to provide a search engine that can be used in all devices that JavaScript can run: web, mobile, desktop, TVs, etc. Everywhere!

## Ok, but what is Asterism?

Asterism is a CLI tool that helps you to convert your database instances (MySQL and PostgreSQL) into Lyra instances and to create searches in a simple way.

## How to install it?

You can install Asterism using `npm|yarn|pnpm`:

```bash
npm install -g @mateonunez/asterism
```

## How to use it?

Asterism provides a simple CLI to manage your Lyra instances and searches.

### Create a new Lyra instance

To create a new Lyra instance you can use the `migrate` command:

```bash
asterism migrate postgres -d postgres -t posts
```

This command will create a new Lyra instance from a PostgreSQL table. You can also use the `mysql` option to create a new Lyra instance from a MySQL table.

A new persistent Lyra instance will be created in the provided folder. (default is `/out`).

### Make a search

To make a search you can use the `search` command:

```bash
asterism search "cool"
```

This command will search the provided string in all the Lyra instances and will return the results.

Example:

```bash
$ asterism search "cool"
