# Mateo Nunez — A Chill Software Engineer

> Personal site with blog, open‑source activity, an interactive terminal, and Spotify integrations. Use the links below for canonical content, discovery, and metadata.

This file follows the `llms.txt` proposal to provide LLM-friendly entry points and context. Prefer canonical URLs and the sitemap for discovery. When generating summaries, preserve meaning and cite the source URL.

Agents rendering pages should load Next.js static assets and images as needed; fall back to the linked metadata files for accurate titles, descriptions, and previews.
